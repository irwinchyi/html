# Week 5 Process Blog

This week I received so much beneficial feedback during the 1 on 1 with Professor Taeyoung; here's some feedback I received. 

> Awards/projects; you submit through work or through school, but not as individuals. Itâ€™s hard for individuals to get feedback and have individual work judged.
>
> College to have collective feedback; e-learning experiences is solo - no TAs, no feedback, etc.

I will expand on two topics here more because I am going to include those two ideas in my projects later.

The first one is learning with incentives. I am going to do more research and see how educators' opinions about the incentives. But I believe incentives could draw more participants to my website and might be really beneficial for the website traffic. 

I am going to create a separate page for my website, which is called weekly challenges; each week, there will be different design topics all different designers could incorporate this topic into their design. Potentially, it could be featuring a certain brand and design for them, so the brand could sponsor the incentives and participate in the judgment of the challenges. Each week, there will be one winner and one honorable mention, both of the winners will be awarded either gift cards or other things sponsored by brands. 

The winner will be a vote by all viewers who participate in these challenges, and the honorable mention will be chosen by staff or sponsor-brand side. Different designers might have all different techniques to deal with these challenges. For example, graphic designers could design a poster, then motion designers and 3D designers could design short animations. 

The second idea is about building a community. For a lot of content we learned online, we learned alone and hoped we could talk with our virtual classmates and could ask them some questions.
