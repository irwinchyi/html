# Feedbacks

I am very glad that I received so many helpful feedbacks from my peers, through this week's process blog, I am about to address some feedback I received as well as the future plan of my project. Like where the next step is. 

Here's the feedback I received from my peers: 

> **What are some things that you (Myra) are learning from Irwin? **
>
> The project he is working on can be so beneficial for future designers - knowing they have a platform with industry professionals providing education.

Seems my project make sense to other design student. I hope my website / platform could really benefit other designer student or student from other background make a smoother transition to their dream careers. 

> **Does the prototype help you understand their project differently? How?** 
>
> Yes because of the wireframe visuals he provided, it gave me an idea of what the website/platform will look like; straightforward, easy to use and visually appealing. 

Currently, I am still work on my wireframe, and the prototype. While I know with current time limitation, I won't be able to build a website which actually work, I still hope I could have several pages build out and use prototype tools like Adobe XD or InVision so other peers could try out how the pages links together eventually. 

> **What are some feedback or recommendations that you would like to share with â–²?**	
>
> The prototype gives the look & feel of the project well for the landing page. Would be great to see the screens for the primary features of the project .

Here's the current look of the landing page, I am not really satisfied with the look and I might have to redo everything to fit my project look.
