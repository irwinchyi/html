## Daydream Study

::: tip Dream?!

Unfortunately, I barely dream, or I never remember my dream. Usually, when I am sick, I will get a weird dream, and most of the time is a nightmare. So it's kind of sad. I am a bit stressed out for this assignment because I am so realistic most of the time and barely daydream. So I am going to write a strange story.

<br>

Owen has a grey cat that seems abnormal today. His cat didn't eat or drink, only meowing all the time. Today is their first day moved into this new apartment. He assumes he is meowing because it's a new environment for him. His cat jumped up on a box, pushing both his both rear paws against it. Suddenly he jumped and pressed the doorknob; before I even noticed, he went out of the door. I chased him out, and he directly ran into the elevator. 

"Sorry Kiddo, I forgot my communication devices." The grey cat said. 

"I have to communicate with my plant." Owen dropped both his jaw and phone. He looked around the elevator; he is alone with his cat. 

"We are not dogs; we don't remember the old home. Drive me back, you stupid human." His cat was rolling the eyeballs and released his claw. "Take me back now." 

Owen picked the cat up, "I might need to see a psychiatrist." He turned on the engine and drive to the old apartment. He opened the door and allowed his cat to get in. 
"What are you looking? What communication devices?" The old apartment smells like bleach. Owen cleaned very thoroughly. "Where is my litter box?" 

"I threw it away; it's old." 

"But I like the old one, where is it?" "It might be still in the dumpster." 

"Grab it back now" "Okay, okay." 

Luckily, the old litter box is still in the dumpster. He set it up at the new apartment. 

"Come here, kiddo," His cat said. "Why do you call me kiddo? You are only eight years old." 

"If I convert to human age, I'm in my 50s. I am in the age of your dad."

"What? Fair. What's the magic of your litter box?" 

"You know, you humans like to follow us everywhere, except the litter box. It might be a litter box outside, but once I push the litter in a certain frequency, it will connect with our mother plants. Don't you humans have something like Tardis? Even I know Doctor Who. Fascinating material to learn human beings." He cat jumped into the litter box. All Owen hears is the cat started bury. The litter box shakes slightly and starts to glow some light, like every entrance in a cliched sci-fi movie.  

Owen put his head into the litter box; interestingly, it smells like spring, he can't imagine the such big space in the litter box. 

Owen woke up on the floor, his head seems hit by something, and his vision is blurry. The litter sand is everywhere on the ground. He is about to get mad because clearly, it's his cat's crime. His cat is purring and kneading on this chest while rubbing Owen with his forehead. 

"Fine, I will stay here a bit longer before I get up and clean your mess." Owen thinks.
