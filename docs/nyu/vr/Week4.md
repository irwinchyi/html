# Whiskers in the Dark

For our group project: Whiskers in the dark, I served the roles and Producer, Creative Director. 

I worked for an advertising agency as a designer. Here, when I was communicating with my account manager, I can sense the pressure they were every project from both sides: clients and us. Clients usually have a very harsh deadline, and then the account manager communicates with us to make sure we can get everything done in time. This position requires strong interpersonal communications and manage stuff in detail. 

In this project as a role as Producer, I feel it is about the same. Although we don't have a client, the pressure is from my peers. The task is to create a tangible, manageable time plan. Although we don't have to actually make things real, it does seem very channeling. 

Outside as Producer, I took some jobs as a designer. I don't want to sound cocky, but I am confident that I could make slides looks nice. So when all of my group members just lay the content flat as text, I went back and picked up everything to make sure it has unique and uniform visual settings. 

I also draw the illustration of the black cat on my iPad with Procreate. I enjoyed doing this digital art for my group, also as a general design practice.

Finally, back to the main topic. Our timeline has been separated as for different phases: 

- Brainstorming, Narrative, Foundation 
- Gathering Art Assets and setting the game logics
- Production and Development 
- Game Release and Marketing

In the end, I also added the platform we will be releasing our product toâ€”exmaple like Oculus Store and PSVR Store.

Chester joined our group meeting; it's very early in the morning in China. I very much appreciate his efforts. (I definitely can't get up that early) I recorded the Zoom meeting and cropped the video about him explaining the idea as a programmer. This video will be played during our presentations. 

Our group did an amazing job and came up with an amazing idea. I am very excited about the presentation tomorrow~
