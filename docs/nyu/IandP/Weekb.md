We are still working on our interview question because it's a really tricky situation for a couple of reasons: 

- Part of our final project will be a one-way interaction website. You could learn something from it. To conduct research will be necessary after the first demo. 
- We still need to reword a lot of questions, and we believe conduct an internal interview might be a better option. 
- At this stage, we are going to shifting our focus to developing the wireframe and prototype. 

We are going to continue to work on our survey during thanksgiving. But before that, I wanna talk about our final deliverables in this project. 

In the past week, we used several different methods to conduct the brainstorming process. One method I do like is using the card decks. While we love how easy it is the using the card decks, we noticed there are very limited card decks focus on post-production. 

We wanted to create a toolkit that compares different mediums that could benefit both professionals and students. Here's the goal: 

- Compare Key differences between mediums. 
- Point out 

The second part of our deliverables will be a website. Giving the time, we won't have the time to do the coding part and let it be a real website. But we are going to start with wireframes, from low fidelity to high fidelity.
