# Week 1 Fantasy Device

::: tip Deviated from Group Idea
Our group was short on time during the discussion time. Couple of days ago, when I do my dishes, I came up with this idea. I hope it's okay to deviate from our group idea.

### Main Functions

- On the upper side of the dishwasher door, you can feed the plate in like you feed CD to the CD player 
- Whenever you need a plate, simply press the DELOAD DISH button, and it will feed you a new one
- The detergent will now put it from the upper side of the machine, so you don't have to bent over to reach it
- Inside, the upper level has hooks/claws to automatically load and deload the plate for you  
- The lover level, you can still use as normal dish washer

### Story Behind it

The dishwasher is not common in a Chinese family. Growing up, washing dishes is always part of me and my mom's job because my dad is the chief. 

When I first arrived in the U.S. and got my own apartment. I never use my dishwasher for a very long time because I don't know how to use it. (I don't even know what detergent is) I use the dishwasher as an extra place to drain and dry out my glassware. I visited my friends' house, and he taught me how to load the plate properly. He even gave me a few detergent blocks to let me try it out. 

The first time when my dishes is ready and clean, I Wowed like Cave Man met the new iPhone. I bragged it with my mom and showed her how effortlessly to wash the dishes. And there are a few problems I hate about using the dishwasher: 

- When I have lower back pain, the last thing I want to do is bend over and put detergent there; why it can't load five detergents at the same time? 
- I hate load dishes, and sometimes I load it wrong, so there always some dishes that are not cleaned properly.
- I hate to unload the dishes. Dishwasher spoiled me not to wash dishes, why not spoil me a little bit more? Could I load and unload the dish for me?

**Few Pain Points of the current product**

- Load and unload process 
- For the over tray: Bend over, stand up, bend over, stand up for the dishes
- Detergent has to be loaded every single time
