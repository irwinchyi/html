Updating the description... Will Edit before class. 

## Intro

How compatible are people while they are doing CPR?

This is such a confusing question. But allow me a few moments to explain why I build this. 





## LCD

I purchased my LCD on the internet. While it said, the product would work with 3.3V. It turns out it worked but unreadable.  

I spend so many hours debugging my LCD because the color contract is so wrong.  I googled several places and talked with Scott; the issue was the LCD has to have more than 3.3 voltage to allow the display to work properly. 

While I have been told, there is 5V on the board, but the pin is not connected together. So I create a little solder bridge connect the A8 pin with VUSB. VUSB transfer 5V from the USB port directly.
