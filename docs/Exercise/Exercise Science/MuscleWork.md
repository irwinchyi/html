# Six Basic Movements

## 3 Types of Muscle Contractions:

Concentric: Tension that involves shortening of the muscle 

Eccentric: Tensions that involves lengthening of the muscle

Isometric: Tension that involves no change in muscle length.

## Six Basic Movements and Muscles Used

Squat, Hinge, Lunge, Pull, Push, Rotation

## Squat

Primarily the hip and knee joints, and secondarily the ankle joint. 

- Lowing the body towards the group

#### Side View

- Hips extend behind
- Knees come over or slightly pass toes 
- Upper body has slight bend 
- Back stays in a neutral position 

#### Front View 

- Knees are out 
- Upper body is vertical 

#### Muscles Used

Gluteus Maximus (butt)

- One of the strongest muscles in the body 
- Responsible for hip extension, or the movement of your hips forward

Quadriceps

- Four muscles that make up the front of your thigh
- Responsible for knee extension, or the movement of the lower part of your knee forward

| ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Rectus Femoris                              | Anterior-inferior spine of ilium and upper lip of acetabulum | Superior aspect of patella and patellar tendon | Extension (Most effective when the hip is extended) | Cycling, Led press, squats, vertical jumping, stair climbing, jumping rope, plyometrics |
| Vastus Lateralis, intermedius, and medialis |                                                              |                                                |                                                     |                                                              |

## Hinge

Hinging involves the movement primarily of the hip joint, and secondary of the knee and ankle joints

- Extending your hips behind you with slight knee bend

Hinge differs from Squat 

- More hip extension 
- More upper body lean 
- Less knee and ankle movement 

High Technique 

- Slight knee bend, about 20 degrees 
- Hip extends behind you 
- Knees stay over ankle 
- Back stays in neutral position 

### Muscle Use

Gluteus Maximus

Hamstrings

## Lunge

Single-leg movement that involves primarily the movement of the knee joint

Focuses on strengthening one leg at a time



**Side View**

- Front Knee does not move beyond toes 
- Torso stays upright 
- Back stays in neutral position
- Back leg serves as an anchor
