Irwin is a goofy/creative advertising guy. 

He is too humble. A lot of people say he is a very talented designer. He said, "Nah, I have a lot to learn."

He is everywhere worldwide, made in Xi'an and Brooklyn. 

He teaches Creative Coding, Media Law, and Media Theory at his alma mater New York University. He also lectures motion graphics design using After Effects, 3D design using Cinema 4D, and Javascripts to the next generation of designers.
