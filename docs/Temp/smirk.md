## Watch TV at Dark Room is Bad

Unfortunately, watching TV in the dark can strain your eyes. When you are watching television in a dark room, your eyes must constantly adjust to the different lighting. You may think the light on the television stays the same, but it actually changes quite a bit. The various scenes and backgrounds of the show have different lighting levels.

Scientific literature has long supported the notion that reducing contrasts in perceived brightness between a visual display and its background will result in reduced visual fatigue and eyestrain.

“Eyestrain can occur when the eyes are fixed on an object for a long period of time, there is poor lighting, or there is glare,” explains Dr John Bullough, a lighting scientist at the LRC and lead researcher on the television study. 

“One scenario believed to cause eyestrain is watching television in a dark room. In this case, visual discomfort is caused by the large difference in luminance between the television screen and the room’s dark background.”

## Waterpik at night time

According to the [American Dental Association](https://www.ada.org/en), a WaterPik is an effective way to remove plaque and reduce the risk of gingivitis. If you use a WaterPik, however, make sure you use it on a **daily basis**. It won’t do you any good if it’s stored in your bathroom cabinet and only used when you feel like it.

Since flossing daily is recommended, using a WaterPik daily is also encouraged. Although you can use it in the morning, night usage is ideal. This is because typically, you’ll go the longest without food or drink overnight. You’ve already had all your meals for the day and can end the day with perfectly clean teeth.

The ideal time to use a Waterpik is before you [brush your teeth](https://riverrundentalspa.com/brush-teeth-too-long/). This is because doing so can allow you to remove food debris and plaque. When you use a Waterpik before brushing your teeth, teeth brushing becomes more effective.
