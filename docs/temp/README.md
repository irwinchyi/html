# Memo

I hope I could have more time to detail my motion, but there is a time limitation, and it is crushed with my class schedule. 
I am confident that I will be a great fit in this position, and I am looking forward to joining WW with my motion skillsets to create more content for social media. 

Here's some of motion examples during the time I was working for BL:
