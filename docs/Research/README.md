> SARM use may be associated with DILI, rhabdomyolysis, tendon rupture, and adverse cardiovascular outcomes. Despite clear and repeated warnings by the FDA regarding use of these unapproved drug products, they continue to be available online and used in the fitness and athletic communities. Providers and public health officials should strongly discourage SARM supplementation and strongly counsel patients on the potential risks of SARM use. SARM-related DILI appears to be dose-related and may initially present with a hepatocellular injury, later converting to a mixed or cholestatic injury. If a patient continues to use SARMs despite warnings, ALT monitoring and dose reduction are strongly recommended in order to detect and reduce the risk of potential DILI as early as possible. The clinician should make clear to the patient that ALT monitoring and dose negotiations do not endorse SARM use. Rather, these are only last resort methods to ensure safety while maintaining a confidential and trusted patient–provider relationship.

## Supplements & OTC Medications

> “Patients ask all the time, ‘What supplements should I be taking?’ They’re wasting money and focus thinking there has to be a magic set of pills that will keep them healthy when we should all be following the evidence-based practices of eating healthy and exercising,” 

Dr. Jeffrey Linder, Chief of General Internal Medicine

Department of Medicine at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine.
